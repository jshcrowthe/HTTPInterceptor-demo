# HTTPInterceptor-Demo
This is just a quick app to demo the use of Angular's $http interceptors.

## Installation
This is an express app so if you don't already have `Node.js` you'll need it. You can get it at https://nodejs.org/. (However that said I would recommend using [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm))

After installing clone/download this repo and open a terminal to run the following:

```bash
npm install
```

You can then get started by doing:
```bash
npm start
```

It will be available at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
